# LI-Counter
This repository contains a simple yet powerful LI Counter created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The LI Counter dynamically counts and displays the number of list items (LI elements) in an unordered or ordered list on your webpage. This can be particularly useful for applications that need to keep track of the number of items in a list.
